# The Coral Rescue Project
## Classifying Coral Health (Healthy or Bleached), Counting, and Detecting Surrounding Fish.
### Project Description: 
 The project was created to use computer vision and deep learning to monitor the health of coral reefs. Our project utilizes models like YOLOv5, CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50 to classify coral conditions and to detect and count the fish in the surrounding area. This scalable approach improves coral reef monitoring and contributes to global marine conservation efforts.
